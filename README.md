# LaundryFY-Management-System

Hey Guys, This is my Semester II project, made fully with JAVA, Swing Library and MySQL.
All the files are written in java language.

The Source code is in: LaundryManagementSystem\src\laundry\management\system

I have made all the files in Apache NET BEANS and I recommend all of you to open Code in Net Beans only.

How to Run:
1. Define your database in Mysql Workbench first (will share the database in few days)
2. In Net Beans, go to Splash.java and run from there.
3. For managing database connections, go to Conn.java
4. Enjoy

for any queries drop a mail to me : prashantsolanki2003@outlook.com

My Teammates: NAVINDER GILL and ABHI GHUDAIYA

PS: I may work on this project to develop it in App, or Website... Feel free to make collabrate.
